# Image Data Collection for Text Recognition – Proposal

## Overview
I am confident in delivering this image data collection project with high quality, accuracy, and full compliance with your guidelines. I have experience working with OCR-oriented datasets, structured data delivery, and strict quality validation.

This proposal outlines my understanding of the task, execution approach, and delivery plan.

## Understanding of Requirements

The project requires:
- Real-world photographs containing visible text
- No screenshots or web-sourced images
- Asset definition: **1 asset = 3 images of the same object from different angles**
- Categories including (but not limited to):
  - Business cards
  - Advertisements
  - Public signage
  - Receipts (grocery, hotel, food/dining)
  - Schedules (bus timetables, store hours)
  - Flyers with business information
  - Invoices
- Proper framing, text clarity, and accurate tagging
- Avoidance of personal or sensitive information (PII)
- Target **95%+ usable rate** after review
- Upload via **Google Form** for tracking and management

## Execution Approach

### Data Collection
- Capture only real-world images using camera devices
- Ensure readable text, correct angles, and consistent lighting
- Maintain category-wise separation of assets

### Quality Control
- Manual review of each image before submission
- Ensure all assets meet clarity and framing standards
- Remove or re-capture any non-compliant images

### Data Organization
- Images grouped per asset (3 images per object)
- Clear naming convention for easy review
- Structured metadata ready for OCR / text recognition workflows

---

## Delivery Plan

- Initial **sample dataset** for quality validation
- Full-scale data collection after approval
- Upload via Google Form as requested
- Clean and organized final dataset

---

## Budget Alignment

- Budget understood: **$0.20 per asset**
- Comfortable working at scale while maintaining quality standards

---

## Optional Clarifications

- Preferred image naming convention (if any)
- Google Form template provided or to be created by me

---

## Why Me

- Experience in OCR and text-recognition-ready datasets
- Strong understanding of data quality compliance
- Comfortable with Excel / CSV / structured data workflows
- Clear communication and sample-first delivery approach
