Yes, that’s correct.

For the MVP stage, the setup is designed so you do not need continuous help from me.

Once configured, you can:

Trigger runs on demand

Update inputs (keywords, locations, filters) without coding

Receive structured output directly in your system

No code changes are required for normal usage.

🔹 Scope & Pricing Clarification (Important)

₹900 – MVP Setup Includes

Bright Data API configuration

Workflow setup & validation

Demo scraping run with sample output (for review only)

This stage is meant to prove the pipeline and data flow, not to hand over full automation scripts.

🔹 Full Self-Managed Automation (Optional Add-On)

If you want to fully manage everything yourself, including:

Running large-scale scraping independently

Cleaning, enrichment & verification logic

Uploading data to your backend endpoints

Running bulk jobs anytime without my involvement

then I provide the complete Python automation package as a one-time add-on (₹5,000).

✅ After this:

You can run small or large-scale scraping on your own

No dependency on me for regular operations

No recurring fees

No limitations on volume (only Bright Data usage cost applies)

🔹 Future Support (Only If Needed)

Managed production runs

Scheduled scraping

Monitoring or optimization

These are not mandatory and can be discussed only if you request them later.

🔹 Summary

MVP (₹900): API setup + demo validation

Full ownership (₹5,000 one-time): Complete automation + large-scale self-run capability

Bright Data usage is always billed directly to your account



Operational Support (Optional – Paid Execution)

One more clarification for transparency:

If you prefer that I personally run the scraping + cleaning + upload tasks for you on a daily or weekly basis (instead of you running them yourself), this will be treated as manual execution support, not part of the MVP setup.

Pricing for manual execution:

₹2,000 per execution task

Minimum appointment: 10 tasks (₹20,000 total)

Each execution task typically includes:

Running scrapers across configured sources

Cleaning & validating data

Uploading final output to your website / API

Basic sanity checks

⏱️ A single execution usually takes ~2 hours.

If at any point:

The data volume is very large (for example ~100,000 records in one run), or

The execution time exceeds ~2 hours

then the support will be charged at ₹1,000 per additional hour, based on actual time spent.

This support is completely optional.
You can always run everything yourself using the automation setup, and opt for manual execution only when needed.
