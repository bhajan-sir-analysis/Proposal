🔍 Project Understanding

This project is not basic scraping.
It requires a compliant, end-to-end lead generation workflow built entirely around Bright Data’s official ecosystem, without risky scraping practices or third-party email tools.

The objective is to:

Extract leads from public company websites

Identify relevant contacts

Verify emails using Bright Data’s own tools

Classify leads using an AI-based logic

Deliver clean, usable data directly into CRM or CSV

⚠️ Compliance First (Very Important)

This solution strictly follows:

Bright Data Terms of Service

Publicly accessible data only

Bright Data APIs for:

Web access

Email discovery

Email verification

No Hunter, NeverBounce, ZeroBounce, or gray-area tools

👉 This ensures long-term stability, no account bans, and enterprise-grade reliability.

🧩 Proposed Architecture
Step 1: Website Data Collection

Use Bright Data Web Unlocker / SERP / Web APIs

Extract:

Company name

Website URL

Public contact pages

Role-related metadata (About, Team, Contact)

Step 2: Contact Discovery & Verification

Use Bright Data email discovery + verification

Capture:

Name

Role

Email

Verification status

Target ≥95% verified accuracy (as per Bright Data reports)

Step 3: AI-Based Lead Classification

Lightweight AI agent to tag leads by:

Industry

Relevance

Buying intent

Rules configurable via simple config file (no recoding needed)

Step 4: Output & Sync

Clean CSV output or

Direct API push to CRM

Duplicate handling & normalization included

🛠 Technology Stack

Bright Data APIs (official)

Python (automation & orchestration)

AI classification logic (rule-based + ML-ready)

CSV / REST API output

Fully documented setup

📦 Deliverables

✔ Fully automated script or low-code bot
✔ Bright Data API setup & configuration
✔ Email verification pipeline
✔ AI tagging logic
✔ Clean CSV / CRM-ready output
✔ Clear documentation
✔ Short handoff call or video walkthrough

🧪 Sample & Related Work

I have built data extraction, automation, and processing pipelines similar in complexity.

Additional projects (data cleaning, PDFs, Excel automation) are available on my GitHub profile.

⏱ Timeline

Initial setup: 2–3 days

End-to-end pipeline: 5–7 days

Testing & handoff: 1–2 days

(Timeline may vary based on scraping scale and CRM integration.)

🤝 Working Style

Clear communication

Step-by-step visibility

No black-box delivery

Budget-conscious execution

Compliance over shortcuts

📞 Next Steps

To proceed smoothly, I would need:

Bright Data account/API access

Target website list or criteria

Desired output format (CSV / CRM API)

Any specific lead qualification rules

Thank you for reviewing this detailed proposal.
I’m confident this solution will give you a clean, scalable, and compliant lead generation system.
